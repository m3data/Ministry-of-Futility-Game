The clerks are excited to have a leader who values action, even if it\'s just theoretical. The walls are lined with reports on hypothetical productivity and action plans that will never be implemented.',
  context: 'In your new role, you spend your days theorising about implementing actions that will never be taken. Your department produces thick and heavy reports about hypothetical productivity that are immediately archived and forgotten after the Minister for Economic Productivity requests the whole Ministry focus on AI.',
